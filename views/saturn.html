        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
        It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.
        It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.
        Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (â™„) represents the god's sickle. </p>
